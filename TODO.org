This is a running list of things that need to taken care of at some point:

 - [ ] Long subtract function too complex
 - [ ] The native messaging is broken on browsers installed by snap
   - this is an issue with the Firefox Snapcraft in particular: https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/firefox-snapcraft-native-messaging-behavior/40437
